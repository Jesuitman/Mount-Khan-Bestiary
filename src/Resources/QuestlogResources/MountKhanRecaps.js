Captain Dogshit and his boy, Boyo, were both found dead in the water. They went to the king who gave them the goal of ascending the mountain to ask the mages living atop the Mount Khan Summit Tower to fix the Moon. The king informed them of who was living in the town after the flood and also gave a few quests. after seeing him, the party went to Sheriff Fats for a bounty on the dreaded crab queen. If the party can take her out, then maybe the influx of crabs in the town will slow down? They also talked to FuqFace BronzeBald who was extremely receptive to the party, completely uncharacteristic of him. Perhaps he was less drunk? He gave them a quest to deliver a note to his ex wife living in the town of Rock Face above. He also gave them a great deal on a spring trap to be used on the crabs and a dagger called the 'Spine Separator' which he got from a child in Darkhold who he fondly remembers bullying. After visiting the smith, the party left for the crab cave. On the way out of town, the party met a river troll who asked them a riddle that it had no idea the answer to. They gave it a quick answer and it left, immediately being consumed by crabs. Finally, the party made it into the crab cave where they found the journal of the last adventurer who was sent there. Having made good progress, the party settled down for the night, eager to see what secrets the crab cave held..."},
    {id: 10, designation: "Who Attended: Kat, Arden, Robert, Joshi", title: "Session 2", description: "What Happened: In Session 2, the party woke up in the crab cave. Loot was abound within the crab cave, all hidden by a mysterious prior visitor. as the party ventured through the cave, they discovered a lone giant crab. Thinking quickly, Melodius impaled the crab on his javelin while Horatio attempted to control it with his animal magnetism. The crabs hive mind was broken, being gifted with individuality and it chose to follow Horatio, identifying Horatio as his own father. With the crabs help, the party was able to make their way through the cave without resistance, looting it freely while preparing for the battle with the queen. Diving into a pool of gore, the party swam to the queen's chambers. The queen had mind controlled the rogue adventurer with its maracas but this mind control was broken by Blaze, drowning out it's noise with his own. While the crab put up a fierce fight, it was no match for the team work of the party who took the severely injured adventurer captive and went back to town. Deciding not to turn him in for a reward, the party talked to Mortos, the town Alchemist. Though they discovered that Mortos was secretly a demon in disguise, the party elected to keep his secret. Grateful, Mortos gave the party access to his boat which would take them to the Produce Aisle and told them of a Mystical Neptunia Unicorn at the heart of the Aisle. The party asked Mortos to hold onto the adventurer and went to get help from We-Ed Bong, the town's mage. We-Ed complained of mice in his attic, so the party helped by squishing the first mouse they found. Upon sleeping in We-Ed's bed, they were transported to a land where everything was giant, including a new Mouse that wanted them dead. This mouse was none other than Stuart Large, who barraged the party with javelins and bars until the confrontation. He proved to be no match for the party though, and upon his death, the party slept for the week."},

The session ended with a giant bug demon merging from the ground, ready to fight the party!"},
    {id: 10, designation: "Who Attended: Kat, Arden, Robert", title: "Session 4", description: "What Happened: Due to Horatio having sick, the party was teleported away from the produce Aisle for the time being to pursue other tasks. The party first met Sponge at the Inn who told them of a music box in the church. After fetching the music box and meeting Brother Twist, the party followed a rumor and went into the Haunted House. After defeating the house wraith within, Orra was able to get her hands on the Gloves of Lart, a staggeringly powerful artifact. Melodius had a breakdown but the party soldiered on, making their way to the lighthouse. It turns out that Captain Dogshit was inside! He gave Melodius the Ruby Javelin Heads and directed them to the cave below the lighthouse. Clearing it out until they got to the boss, Aquamentus the Unicorn Dragon, Melodius was able to talk past the dragon and into the final treasure room. Melodius got his hands on 6 new and improved GemSpark javelins, Blaze got a necklace known as The Source of Wisdom, and the party acquired a newfound sense of friendship and belonging. After the party was teleported back to town, the session ended for the night."},
