    {id: 1, designation: "Type: Diary", title: "Author: Crab Cave Adventurer", description: "Whoever is reading this, I have a question for you. Why are you reading a Diary? These are personal. I jest. I had thought the crab queen would be an easy job, I shouldn't have spent so much on booze. The Rest of the gold is hidden in chests around the cave. I dont understand, I clear the cave constantly but it keeps repopulating. I keep getting grabbed in my sleep. I have tried to sleep six times so I can guess six days have passed. The crabs won't stop drawing blood when I sleep. I am so tired all the time. I can't keep doing this. There is only one part of the cave left to explore and its one I have put off because it frankly looks terrifying. I keep hearing music coming from that infernal section of the cave. I think the queen may be there. I am going to board the cave up and head deeper in. If you are reading this then it means that I am dead and you have breached the cave entrance. Finish what I started. Please."},
    {id: 2, designation: "Type: Instructions", title: "Author: Mortos, Defiler of Nations", description: "Take the boat docked at the edge of the palace. It will take you to the Produce Aisle and take you back. The produce Aisle plays by different rules than the rest of the mountain, I think its because of the magic of the Neptunia Unicorn. You will need to clear out each section one encounter at a time. If one of your party members dies in combat, they will reappear at the boat. Use this to your advantage! In addition, the gold rewards are doubled here so you can get some serious cash. When all party members fall in an encounter you will be forced to reset the island, facing all of the monsters you did before. The produce means you will heal between each encounter. When you get through the last encounter, you'll see a crater with a tree in the center. This is the home of the Neptunia Unicorn. Put your weapons away immediately when you see the tree because the Unicorn will be hostile to anyone holding a weapon. It can grant a limited Neptunia Wish if you approach it. If you somehow manage to upset it and have to kill it, I can replicate the wish by grinding its horn into a potion. I do not want to do this however, so please be careful."},
    {id: 3, designation: "Type: Letter", title: "Author: Lart", description: "I am Lart, often called the Savior of Khan. These are the last days of my life. Everyone praises me for my duties but in truth, Khan is what saved me. I wouldn't be half of who I am today if not for the people of Khan. I wish I could stay forever, but the pull of my other half has been getting stronger. I can feel the danger they are in. I must go to help them. I can feel my own life force being sapped away, I am trying so hard to stay alive but I am just more exhausted, more morose every day. Whoever is reading this, congratulations on beating the House Wraith I asked to guard my house. You now inherit the gloves I once wore in combat. They will allow you to hodl the other pieces of my armor and weapons which I have scattered across the mountain. I Pray that you are pure of heart and can unite my relics to finish what I started. I wish I could accompany you, I want nothing more than to help you battle and endless horde of demons but I just don't have it in me anymore. You can find my gauntlets in the town of DarkHold, the mayor has them. Be strong, finish what I started. Thank you."},
